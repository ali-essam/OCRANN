Optical Character Recognition using Neural Networks

The aim of this project is to design an OCR software (now only digit recognition) using Neural Networks.

Project is divided to 3 Parts:
1- Neural Network Library : Implements a NN library to run NNs and train them though Backpropagation.
2- OCRANN_PC : Will be mainly used to train the OCR network.
3- OCRANN_Android : An interface to the OCR NN
